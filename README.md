# Smart Grid Optimization Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project demonstrates how **deep learning** can be used to optimize energy distribution in a smart grid. It predicts grid demand by analyzing renewable energy generation (solar and wind) and electric vehicle (EV) charging demand, helping utility companies **balance energy supply** and **reduce grid strain**.

## Features
**Predicts grid load** based on solar/wind energy and EV charging demand  
**Uses deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras)** for accurate energy forecasting  
**Optimizes energy distribution** to prevent grid overload  

## Dataset
The model is trained on simulated energy data, including:
- **Solar Generation (MW)**
- **Wind Generation (MW)**
- **EV Charging Demand (MW)**
- **Grid Load (MW) â€“ Target Variable**

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Deep Learning)
- **NumPy** (Data Handling)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
